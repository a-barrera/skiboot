skiboot-5.9.8
=============

skiboot 5.9.8 was released on Friday January 5th, 2018. It replaces
:ref:`skiboot-5.9.7` as the current stable release in the 5.9.x series.

Over :ref:`skiboot-5.9.7`, there is one important change. In lieu of setting
fire to every computer in the world, skiboot will now pass on certain processor
init flags from earlier firmware so the OS can make intelligent decisions on
what mitigation techniques it also needs to employ.

The change is:

- hdata: Parse IPL FW feature settings

  Add parsing for the firmware feature flags in the HDAT. This
  indicates the settings of various parameters which are set at IPL time
  by firmware.
